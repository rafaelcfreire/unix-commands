#### Home Directory Shortcut
In Unix systems, you can reference your home directory from anywhere you're located just typing the tilde(~) character. If you try ~ in terminal, you get the following message:

```sh
$ ~
-bash: /Users/rafaelcfreire: is a directory
```

#### Present Working Directory(pwd)
This command prints where you are at any moment in your file system. Go to a specific folder and type <i>pwd</i> in your terminal:

```sh
$ pwd
/Users/rafaelcfreire/github/unix-commands
```
