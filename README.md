#### Home Directory Shortcut
In Unix systems, you can reference your home directory from anywhere you're located just typing the tilde(~) character. If you try ~ in terminal, you get the following message:

```sh
$ ~
-bash: /Users/rafaelcfreire: is a directory
```

#### Present Working Directory
This command prints where you are at any moment in your file system. Go to a specific folder and type <i>pwd</i> in your terminal:

```sh
$ pwd
/Users/rafaelcfreire/github/unix-commands
```

#### Listing Files
The <i>ls</i> command show the files and directories that are under your current directory by default, if you want to see from different directories just specify it address as shown next. 

List the current directory
```sh
$ ls
```

List the <i>files</i> directory
```sh
$ ls /home/personal/files
```

The sintax of the <i>ls</i> command is:

```sh
ls [options] [names]
```

And you can get the list of options [here](http://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php)
